# Winter Lodge
This is my first custom moon for Lethal Company.

## Description
This moon is covered in snow and spruce trees. The main entrance can be found at lodge by following the road leading towards it from the ship.

### Inspiration
I was inspired by this [Fable 2 demondoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04cHGu1y-FE) and wanted to create something similar in Lethal Company.

### Features:
- Routing cost: 250
- Walkable distance to both Main and Fire (a bit between Vow and Assurance)
- Cruiser compatible
- Mansion Interior
- Small chance for mineshaft interior
- All Scrap spawnable
- Scrap around 2000 ~ 4000 of value inside
- Enemies (by default):
    - Inside:
        - No Coilheads
    - Outside:
        - No Oldbirds
        - Small chance for Giants
        - No Flowersnakes
