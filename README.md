# WinterLodge
Lethal Compant custom moon "Winter Lodge  
This is my first custom moon for Lethal Company.

## Description
This moon is covered in snow and spruce trees. The main entrance can be found at lodge by following the road leading towards it from the ship. The fire exit is located at the end of the small creek.

### Inspiration
I was inspired by this [Fable 2 demondoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04cHGu1y-FE) and wanted to create something similar in Lethal Company.

### Features:
- Walkable distance to both Main and Fire (a bit between Vow and Assurance)
- Cruiser compatible
- Mansion Interior
- Small chance for mineshaft interior
- All Scrap spawnable
- Around 2000 ~ 4000 scrap inside
- Enemies (by default):
    - Inside:
        - No Coilheads
    - Outside:
        - No Oldbirds
        - Small chance for Giants
        - No Flowersnakes
